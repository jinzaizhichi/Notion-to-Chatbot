## 📡 API Endpoints & Reference

**Base URL**: `https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1`
**Auth**: `x-api-key: <YOUR_API_KEY>` (API-key access is currently in closed beta — see the note at the top of the README)

All responses return `{"request_id": "<id>", "status": "processing"}`; poll `GET /api/v1/predictions/{request_id}/result` until `status` is `completed` and read `outputs[0]` for the final muapi-hosted video URL.

### 1. HappyHorse 1.0 Text-to-Video — 1080p
**Endpoint**: `POST https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/happy-horse-1-text-to-video-1080p`

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `prompt` | string | yes | — | Scene description. |
| `aspect_ratio` | enum | no | `"16:9"` | One of `16:9`, `9:16`, `1:1`, `4:3`, `3:4`. |
| `duration` | int | no | `5` | Integer seconds, `4 <= duration <= 15`. |
| `webhook_url` | URL | no | — | Optional — a `POST` is fired to this URL on completion. |

```bash
curl --location --request POST "https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/happy-horse-1-text-to-video-1080p" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --data-raw '{
      "prompt": "A majestic eagle soaring over snow-capped mountains at sunrise",
      "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
      "duration": 10
  }'
```

### 2. HappyHorse 1.0 Text-to-Video — 720p
**Endpoint**: `POST https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/happy-horse-1-text-to-video-720p`

Identical request body to the 1080p endpoint above. Output resolution is encoded in the URL — costs ~half of the 1080p tier (see [Pricing](#-pricing)).

```bash
curl --location --request POST "https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/happy-horse-1-text-to-video-720p" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --data-raw '{
      "prompt": "A majestic eagle soaring over snow-capped mountains at sunrise",
      "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
      "duration": 10
  }'
```

### 3. HappyHorse 1.0 Image-to-Video — 1080p
**Endpoint**: `POST https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/happy-horse-1-image-to-video-1080p`

The first image in `images_list` is used as the start frame and the generated clip animates outward from it.

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `prompt` | string | no | `""` | Optional — guides motion direction/mood. |
| `images_list` | string[] | yes | — | Single-element list: the start-frame image URL. |
| `aspect_ratio` | enum | no | `"16:9"` | Same set as above. Output is cropped/padded if ratio differs from the input image. |
| `duration` | int | no | `5` | `4 <= duration <= 15`. |
| `webhook_url` | URL | no | — | Optional completion webhook. |

```bash
curl --location --request POST "https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/happy-horse-1-image-to-video-1080p" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --data-raw '{
      "prompt": "The clouds drift slowly, light shifts from golden to dusk",
      "images_list": ["https://example.com/landscape.jpg"],
      "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
      "duration": 10
  }'
```

### 4. HappyHorse 1.0 Image-to-Video — 720p
**Endpoint**: `POST https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/happy-horse-1-image-to-video-720p`

Same body as the 1080p I2V endpoint; cheaper 720p output.

```bash
curl --location --request POST "https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/happy-horse-1-image-to-video-720p" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --header "x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  --data-raw '{
      "prompt": "The clouds drift slowly, light shifts from golden to dusk",
      "images_list": ["https://example.com/landscape.jpg"],
      "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
      "duration": 10
  }'
```

### 5. Poll a prediction
**Endpoint**: `GET https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/predictions/{request_id}/result`

Returns the muapi standard prediction envelope — `status` transitions through `queued` → `processing` → `completed` (or `failed`). On completion the `outputs` array contains muapi-hosted video URLs; the top-level `video` key mirrors `outputs[0]` for convenience.

### 6. Upload a local file
**Endpoint**: `POST https://api.muapi.ai/api/v1/upload_file`

Multipart-form helper to host a local image on muapi so it can be referenced in `images_list`.

### 🎬 Film & Cinematic Storytelling

**Cave Flashlight Cinematic**
```text
A flashlight beam exploring a cave system, illuminating wet limestone formations. The light catches crystalline calcite deposits that glitter and flash. Where the beam passes through shallow standing water, it creates bright caustic patterns on the submerged floor. Stalactites cast long, swinging shadows as the flashlight moves.
```

**Flower Time-Lapse Continuity**
```text
A flower blooming and wilting over two weeks, one photo per day. Same vase, same window, same angle. Light changes with weather.
```

**Tracking Shot Street Escape**
```text
TRACKING SHOT follows her from behind as she runs through the street. Sari fabric flows and trails behind her, catching the wind. CLOSE-UP on bare feet hitting the ground. Fabric billowing. She glances back. Keeps running. Determined.
```

### 🛍️ Advertising & Product Storytelling

**Voice Assistant Day-In-The-Life**
```text
A time-lapse of a family using a home voice assistant throughout the day. From setting morning alarms, playing music, checking the weather, and controlling smart lights, the product integrates seamlessly into their daily life.
```

### 🎨 Animation & Stylized Visuals

**1990s Action Cartoon Firebending**
```text
1990s action cartoon style. A young martial artist performs a firebending kata. The flames are hand-drawn with thick outlines and bold orange-yellow gradients. Dynamic camera swoops around the character. The fighting stance shows anime influence while maintaining Western animation proportions. Smoke effects use the signature layered look of the era.
```

**Cyberpunk Android Repair Bay**
```text
Cyberpunk anime style. A female android sits in a maintenance chair as robotic arms repair her damaged arm. The skin panel is open, revealing intricate servos and fiber-optic cables beneath. Her eyes are blank and unfocused during the repair cycle. Neon city lights filter through rain-streaked windows. Cool blue and pink color palette with high contrast shadows.
```

### 📱 Social, Viral & UGC-Style Concepts

**Graduation Banner Chaos**
```text
A massive "CONGRATULATIONS GRADUATES" banner being unfurled across a university building by maintenance workers on the roof. The wind catches it mid-unfurl, turning it into a sail that nearly lifts one worker off their feet. Coworkers grab him, everyone laughs, and the banner finally drops into place. Below, students start taking selfies immediately.
```

### 💡 Prompt Engineering Tips for HappyHorse 1.0

- **Name the shot.** Tokens like `TRACKING SHOT`, `CLOSE-UP`, `WIDE ANGLE`, `TIME-LAPSE` meaningfully change camera behavior.
- **Specify the style bucket.** `1990s action cartoon style`, `cyberpunk anime style`, `cinematic 35mm film` — style tokens front-load the aesthetic.
- **Keep motion concrete.** "Wind catches it mid-unfurl" beats "it moves dramatically."
- **For I2V, describe the motion, not the subject.** The image already provides the subject — the prompt should describe what changes.
